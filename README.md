## Project Goals

The frontend goal was to create a mobile-first, minimalistic user interface for social recipe posting platform. 
Users can easily browse, search, and interact with recipe posts.
The focus is on essential features such as viewing posts, managing personal content, posting your favorite recipe, and connecting with the community.

## User Stories

1.  **As a Visitor**, I want to easily navigate and discover food posts without the need for an account, enjoying a clutter-free and inviting interface.
2.  **As a User**, I need a straightforward registration and login process, granting me access to a personalized dashboard that feels intuitive and uncluttered.
3.  **As a User**, I want to smoothly transition between different sections like posts feed, liked posts, and my own recipes, within a minimalist layout.
4.  **As a User**, I desire a simple and focused recipe posting feature, allowing me to share my culinary creations.
5.  **As a User**, I look for an engaging way to connect with other food enthusiasts, follow their profiles, and like their posts.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
